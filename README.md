### Inspiration
**Stardew Valley**
Stardew Valley is an iconic farming simulator, and the key inspiration for the mood and aesthetic of the game.
The cute, comfy vibe and strong sense of community in particular will contrast & compliment the post-apocalyptic setting well.

**Kingdom**
The delectable pixel art graphics of the Kingdom series of games, where every moment is desktop-background-worthy is a goal.

**Simon Stålenhag**
The works of Simon Stalenhag, particularly of decrepid & rotting futuristic machinery is the style of post-apocalypse I want to portray.
A world of hope and timid happiness, with scars of a devastating past - not a depressing deadline of annihilation.
